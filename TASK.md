# Homework #20: Interacting with RESTful APIs

## Overview
This homework is designed to reinforce and apply your understanding of RESTful APIs. You will be extending a Java application to interact with a RESTful API using various HTTP methods.

## Objectives
- Implement HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in Java.
- Understand real-world applications of RESTful APIs through research.

## Tasks

### Part 1: Java Application Extension
Extend a Java application to include the following HTTP methods:
1. **GET**: Retrieve data from the API.
2. **POST**: Create a new resource.
3. **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
4. **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the API.

Use the JSON Placeholder API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`) for a practical experience.

### Part 2: Research
Write a brief summary (about one page) on a real-world application of RESTful APIs. Explore how companies like Twitter, Google, or Spotify use these APIs in their services.

## Submission
- Submit the source code of your Java application.
- Include clear comments and documentation in your code.
- Attach your research summary as a separate document.
